**INTRO TEXT SLIDE ONE**
Welcome to the galaxy called the Copernicus Nebula. It may appear to be beautiful and peaceful from up
above but this is the furthest thing from the truth. Over 100 years ago there was a meteor that made a
devastating impact on planet of cats.
**INTRO TEXT SLIDE TWO**
Within hours after the impact the planet was showing signs of a total ecosystem collapse. The air became
thin and hard to breathe and all the vegatation around was starting to decay. Surviving cats on the
planet knew that evacuating their home was no longer an optional choice they had to make.
**INTRO TEXT SLIDE THREE**
The closest neighboring planet so happened to be inhabited by dogs, showed up in droves of cargo ships
ready to evacuate the cats to safety. Since the kind gesture to house the surviving cats, life on the
dog planet has not been the same. Resources have become scarce and tentions between the two races have
been high.
**INTRO TEXT SLIDE FOUR**
The galatic federation has decided to test fund a new project to secure resources. If the test project
is sucessful they will offically have a program to procure and redistribute resources from across the
galaxy. The federation has chosen YOU out of many applicants.
**INTRO TEXT SLIDE FIVE**
