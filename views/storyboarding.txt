**INTRO TEXT SLIDE ONE**
Welcome to the galaxy called the Copernicus Nebula. It may appear to be beautiful and peaceful from up
above but this is the furthest thing from the truth. Over 100 years ago there was a meteor that made a
devastating impact on planet of cats.
**INTRO TEXT SLIDE TWO**
Within hours after the impact the planet was showing signs of a total ecological collapse. The air became
thin and hard to breathe and all the vegatation around was starting to decay. Surviving cats on the
planet knew that evacuating their home was no longer an optional choice they had to make.
**INTRO TEXT SLIDE THREE**
The closest neighboring planet so happened to be inhabited by dogs, showed up in droves of cargo ships
ready to evacuate the cats to safety. Since the kind gesture to house the surviving cats, life on the
dog planet has not been the same. The planet was renamed "Cat-a-strophic Chaos", resources have become
scarce and tentions between the two races have been high.
**INTRO TEXT SLIDE FOUR**
The galatic federation has decided to test fund a new project to secure resources. If the test project
is sucessful they will offically have a program to procure and redistribute resources from across the
galaxy. The federation has chosen YOU out of many applicants.
**INTRO TEXT SLIDE FIVE**
Do you understand this mission?
    Yes?        No?

**IF YES INTRO DIAGLOG**
We are pleased that you understand the imporance of this mission. We give you starting funds and fuel
to start you off on your jouney. It is imporant for you to travel far and wide to find more sustainable
food resources by trade. The whole planet of Cat-a-strophic Chaos is relying on YOU!

**IF NO REPEAT SLIDE FOUR**

>> PLANETS <<
=================================================================

Notes: Planets with intro text.

1. planetONE = Cat-a-trophic Chaos
Originally known as Lab-ra-cadabra-dor is inhabited buy both Cats and Dogs. Tensions currently remain
high as the cat population increased steadily and caused a scarcity of food resources among the inhabitants.
This is your home planet, find resouces to feed your people!

2. planetTWO = Deja Moo
Simply a farm planet where there are no humans. All laws and trade are controlled by alpha pigs. The 
pigs dictate the way of living by having high taxes. Each animal must contribute a personal resource
once a week which the pigs trade internationally for money. What greedy pigs!

3. planetTHREE = Hue-Manatee
A gentle aquatic planet where there is no war or work. This planet is dominantly filled with friendly 
sealife like starfish, manatees and seacucumbers. No sharks live here. All life here is slow and
peaceful. The inhabitants of this planet simply love grazing on food and basking out in the sun.
The only stressful thing these residents have to worry about is simply getting to things on-time.
If anything were to befall this peaceful planet... Iron Man-atee will save them!

4. planetFOUR = Dumble-dope
Magic... moons... and mystical things. Here is the part where I rhyme because it's like we are
spell-casting things. This planet obviously makes magic but unfourtunately sometimes the outcomes
end up tragic. This is the furthest planet, far away, but all these mythical creatures are here to
stay.

5. planetFIVE = Ice-olated
Nothing but hard ice for miles away. At first glance during the day it seems like a desolate place
with absolutly no inhabitants but on closer inspection there are pengins hiding all over the place.
During the night, almost every night, every animal of all races compete in competitive ice skating!

=================================================================
>> RESOURCES REDEFINED <<
=================================================================
Notes: Each planet will choose a max FOUR resouces (some will have less) that will make up the planets
unique resource table. Resource table will have a MAX of two in each collumn. Each planet will require
ONE resource they need except main planet. Cat-a-strophic planet needs only (3) counts TOTAL food item
(they will start off with vegtables for demo gameplay to go faster). Either one of each or mutiples of
the same to reach three. For other planets they only have ONE reqirement to fill but if we had more time
it would be more than one. I will make example tables of a planets unique resource table. VALUES already
labeled. Also note, you may trade with a planet even though you aren't giving them items they need. You
may change the amount of values for planets if you don't like it. :)

> Food <
1. FoodONE - Meat
2. FoodTWO - Vegtables
3. FoodTHREE - Seafood
--------------------------------------------
> Energy Types <
1. EnergyONE - Water (drinking water)
2. EnergyTWO - Fuel
3. EnergyTHREE - Money <--- This mechanic is necessary because we can trade ITEMS for Money
--------------------------------------------
> Unique Resouces <
1. UniqueONE - Medicine
2. UniqueTWO - Technology (information sharing)
3. UniqueTHREE - Magic (used to double up an item)
